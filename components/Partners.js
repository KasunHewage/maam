            We already manufacture biscuits under the “Tradesman” brand but to

            Once we mastered the art of prepared biscuits & cookies, our success
            there paved the way for us to broaden our offering and go beyond our
            own brand name to private labeling. Because MAAM is all about the
            outrageous taste of its biscuits range, our preference has always
            been, whenever possible, to have direct relationships with the
            clients.
